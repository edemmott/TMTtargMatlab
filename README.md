# TMTtargMatlab
Matlab functions for generating targeting lists for Xcalibur or Maxquant.Live from Maxquant evidence.txt files

These functions have been tested on Windows 10, and Max OS X and Matlab versions R2017b and R2018a.

## Basic use
```matlab
% Basic function call:
  targXcal( data , 'filename.csv');
```

**data** can be either a table or a structure. In most cases, a user will have imported the **evidence.txt** file generated by Maxquant into Matlab using the readtable function, e.g.
```matlab
% Import using readtable
  data = readtable('evidence.txt');
```
The **filename** can include path details, if the user does not add .csv to the end of the filename this will be done automatically.

## Function default behavior
The function has been written on the basis that after importing the evidence.txt file, the user will have selected peptides of interest. However the function can apply a number of broad filters to the data depending on the parameters set. 
By default, the function removes peptides identified as contaminants or reverse database hits ('FilterRevCon', true). It also selects for unique peptide sequence/charge state combinations. If multiple entries for the same sequence/charge state are identified, the function selects the entry with the highest intensity ('Unique', true).

## Optional input arguments

## Optional output arguments
The function can optionally output the table of targets generated that is used to create the inclusion list.csv file.
```matlab
% Output table
outputTable = targXcal( data , 'filename.csv');
```
